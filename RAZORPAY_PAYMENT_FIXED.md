# âœ… Razorpay Payment Integration FIXED

## Issues Found & Fixed

### ðŸ”´ **Issue 1: Subscription Page Bypass**
**Location:** `lib/features/sell/subscription_page.dart`

**Location:** `lib/features/sell/signup_page.dart`
**Problem:** After selecting plan, clicking "Next" went directly to business details without payment
**Fix:**

- âœ… Updated flow: Qualify â†’ Plan Selection â†’ **PAYMENT** â†’ Business Details â†’ KYC â†’ Pending
