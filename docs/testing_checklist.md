## Vidyut App – Comprehensive Testing Checklist

Scope: For each screen, run Golden, Widget, Routing, and Unit tests. Record issues in Backlog after executing the tests. Treat checkboxes as acceptance criteria; only check when verified by automated tests or rigorous manual validation.

Legend:
- [ ] = Not verified
- [x] = Verified/passing
- [!] = Known issue (move to Backlog)

Breakpoints to validate (unless N/A on mobile-only):

Accessibility & UX baseline across all screens:
- [ ] Focus order and visible focus ring
- [ ] All interactive controls have labels/hints
- [ ] Semantics: headings, lists, buttons, images
- [ ] Dynamic text scale ≈ 1.3x does not break layout
- [ ] High contrast mode (if applicable) retains legibility
