# User-to-Seller Flow Implementation

## Overview

This implementation provides a seamless flow for users to become sellers after taking a subscription plan. Users can sign up, select a plan, and access all seller features using their credentials.

## Key Components

### 1. User Role Models (`lib/features/auth/models/user_role_models.dart`)

- **AppUser**: Comprehensive user model with role, subscription, and seller status
- **UserRole**: Enum for buyer, seller, admin, guest roles
- **UserStatus**: Enum for active, pending, suspended, inactive status
- **SubscriptionPlan**: Enum for free, plus, pro, enterprise plans
- **RoleTransitionRequest**: Model for tracking role change requests

### 2. User Role Service (`lib/services/user_role_service.dart`)

- **UserRoleService**: Manages user role transitions and seller activation
- **Key Methods**:
  - `initializeUser()`: Initialize user from Firebase Auth
  - `requestSellerRole()`: Request to become a seller with plan selection
  - `activateSellerRole()`: Admin function to approve seller requests
  - `canAccessSellerFeatures()`: Check if user can access seller features

### 3. Seller Onboarding Page (`lib/features/auth/pages/seller_onboarding_page.dart`)

  1. **Plan Selection**: Choose from Plus, Pro, or Enterprise plans
  2. **Business Details**: Company information, GST, contact details
  3. **Materials Selection**: Choose materials they work with
  4. **Review & Submit**: Review information and submit request

### 4. Updated Auth Wrapper (`lib/app/auth_wrapper.dart`)

- **Dynamic Profile Button**: Changes based on user role
  - Guest: "Guest User" (orange)
  - Buyer: "Become Seller" (blue)
  - Seller: "Seller Hub" (green)
- **Profile Dialog**: Shows appropriate options based on user status
- **Seamless Integration**: Works with existing Firebase auth
