**File Created:** `lib/state/messaging/firebase_messaging_providers.dart`

**Providers Created:**
- ✅ `firebaseConversationsProvider` - Stream all conversations for user
- ✅ `firebaseMessagesProvider(conversationId)` - Stream messages for conversation
- ✅ `firebaseConversationProvider(conversationId)` - Get single conversation
- ✅ `messagingServiceProvider` - Service for messaging operations

**Features Implemented:**
```dart
✅ Real-time conversation streams
✅ Real-time message streams
✅ Send messages with attachments
✅ Create new conversations
✅ Mark conversations as read
✅ Toggle pin status
✅ Delete conversations
✅ Get/create direct conversations between users
```

**Firebase Collection:**
```
/conversations/{conversationId}
  - title, subtitle, participants, is_pinned, is_support
  - last_message: {text, sender_id, sent_at}
  - created_at, updated_at

/conversations/{conversationId}/messages/{messageId}
  - sender_id, text, attachments, sent_at
  - is_read, reply_to_message_id
```

**Sync Flow:**
1. User A sends message → Writes to `/conversations/{id}/messages`
2. User B's `firebaseMessagesProvider` streams → Instantly receives message
3. **Real-time chat working!** ✅

✅ Update seller logo
✅ Update seller materials
✅ Update seller categories
✅ Admin: Verify seller
✅ Admin: Unverify seller
✅ Check if user has seller profile
✅ Get seller profile by ID
✅ Search sellers by location/materials
```

  - city, state, pincode
  - phone, email, website, description
  - categories[], materials[]
  - logo_url

3. User views seller products → Sees updated seller info
4. **Seller profile sync working!** ✅

## 🔄 HOW TO TEST THE FIXES

### Test 1: Messaging Sync
```dart
1. Open app in 2 browser tabs
2. Tab 1: User A opens conversation with User B
3. Tab 1: User A sends message "Hello from A!"
4. Tab 2: User B's conversation updates instantly
5. Tab 2: User B sends reply "Hi from B!"
6. Tab 1: User A sees reply instantly
✅ Expected: Real-time bidirectional messaging
```

### Test 2: Product Sync
```dart
1. Seller page: Create new product "Test Widget"
2. Admin page: View products list
3. ✅ Expected: "Test Widget" appears immediately
4. Seller page: Update product price to $99
5. User page: Search for "Test Widget"
6. ✅ Expected: Shows $99 price immediately
```

### Test 3: Seller Profile Sync
```dart
1. Seller page: Update company name to "ABC Corp"
2. Seller page: Update logo
