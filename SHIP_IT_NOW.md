## 🎯 Next 3 Steps (3-4 hours)

### Step 1: Smoke Tests (2 hours)
Run these 4 critical flows:

**1. Auth (30 min)**
```
✓ Phone + OTP login works
✓ Guest mode works
✓ Logout/re-login works
```

**2. Search (30 min)**
```
✓ Search query returns results
✓ Filters work (category, price, location)
✓ Product detail loads
✓ Image gallery navigates
```

**3. Profile (30 min)**
```
✓ Profile loads
✓ Edit fields + save
✓ Data persists
```

**4. Admin (30 min)**
```
✓ Dashboard shows metrics
✓ KYC list appears
✓ Approve action works
✓ Non-admin blocked
```

### Step 2: Deploy Staging (1 hour)
```bash
# Build
./scripts/build_web.sh

# Deploy to staging
firebase deploy --only hosting --project vidyut-staging

# Verify
# Visit staging URL and retest flows
```

### Step 3: Ship Production (30 min)
```bash
# Tag release
git add .
git commit -m "Release v1.0.0: Production-ready architecture"
git tag -a v1.0.0 -m "Phases 1 & 2 complete"
git push origin main --tags

# Deploy production
firebase deploy --only hosting --project vidyut-production

# Monitor
# Watch Firebase console for errors
```
